				<h1>Our Founder</h1>
				<img src="image/night.jpg" alt="one winter night"/>
				<p>Long long time ago, when time travelling was still a new technology and the only method of time travel was through those big and bulky government owned room-sized machines, our founder was a poor student studying in a cold cold region on planet Earth and all she could afford were cookies to survive the harsh weathers.</p>
				<p>Every night, she would camp in front of her laptop and munch on cookies to stay awake and finish her heaping assignments. On one such night, while she was doing her nightly ritual of cookie munching, she was reminded of the warmth at home back when she was just a little girl.</p>
				<p>That was when the idea struck her: What if we could time travel through cookies?</p>

				<h1>30 years of R&D </h1>
				<img src="image/spaceship.jpg" alt="spaceship in space"/>
				<p>While the company participated in selling the older, more mundane time machines, it wasn't until thirty years later that the company finally had its breakthrough and created the first Tookie&#8482; that the company finally achieved its mission.</p>
				<p>Tookie&#8482;, much like the name suggests, is a Time + Cookie. It allows time travellers to travel in time while eating the cookie. Much like any other time machines that are controlled by the time traveller, a Tookie&#8482; is connected with the time traveller when they eat the Tookie&#8482;. By thinking of a certain time and place while eating the Tookie&#8482;, the Tookie&#8482; will bring the time traveller to that time and place.</p>
				<p>More instructions of how to operate a Tookie&#8482; is provided in the user manual included with each purchase.</p>

				<h1>Why Tookie&#8482; </h1>
				<img src="image/cookieStory.jpg" alt="vintage cookies"/>
				<p>The history of cookies can traced back centuries. People have been eating cookies for a very long time, and it is way more subtle than the huge metal boxes that time machines are usually made like.</p>
				<p>Tookie&#8482; allows mobility as it can be kept in lunchboxes or inside your pockets. An added bonus to this is, if they were found in your possession, it would not be suspected as an advanced technology, which is especially useful for travelling to the past.</p>
				<p>When travelling with Tookie&#8482;, you will not have to worry about how to hide your time machine and its very design is subtle enough and you will be able to focus on enjoying your time journey.</p>
